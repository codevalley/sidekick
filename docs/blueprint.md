# **Product Blueprint: LLM Agent as an Executive's Second Brain**

## **Introduction**

In the demanding world of executive leadership, managing a plethora of tasks, information, and relationships is a constant challenge. Executives are judged by their ability to "get things done" and their dependability, which hinges on timely responses and follow-through on commitments. To excel, executives need a personal assistant that not only organizes tasks but also understands context, priorities, dependencies, and the key people involved.

This blueprint outlines the development of an AI-powered agent—an intelligent assistant akin to Alfred for Batman or Jarvis for Tony Stark—that acts as a second brain for executives. This agent will interact naturally, manage tasks efficiently, and maintain a dynamic knowledge base, all while understanding and prioritizing relationships with individuals by name.

---

## **Objectives**

- **Natural Interaction**: Enable seamless communication through conversational language, capturing tasks, context, and nuances as the executive would naturally express them.
- **Intelligent Task Management**: Classify and prioritize tasks based on type, urgency, dependencies, and the people involved.
- **Dynamic Knowledge Base**: Maintain and update contextual information to aid in decision-making and task prioritization.
- **Relationship Awareness**: Recognize and manage relationships with key individuals, considering their roles, preferences, and importance.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Provide timely and relevant suggestions on what the executive should focus on next.

## **Agent Architecture**

### **1. Interaction Flow**

#### **Data Ingestion**

- **Conversation-Based Input**: The executive communicates with the agent through natural language, mentioning tasks, ideas, and people by name.
- **Context Capture**: The agent extracts relevant information, understanding the nuances of the executive's language.

#### **Processing and Classification**

- **Task Classification**: Tasks are categorized into predefined types based on their characteristics.
- **People Identification**: Names mentioned are linked to profiles in the People Directory, capturing relationships and preferences.
- **Contextual Linking**: Tasks are associated with relevant knowledge base entries and people profiles.

#### **Storage**

- **Structured Documents**: Information is stored in organized Markdown or YAML files, each dedicated to tasks, people, or knowledge entries.
- **Version Control**: Changes are tracked to maintain history and enable easy updates.

### **2. Task Types Overview**

#### **Type 1: Quick and Trivial Tasks**

- **Description**: Simple actions requiring minimal effort, such as sending an email or approving a document.
- **Characteristics**:
  - No dependencies on events or other individuals.
  - Best addressed immediately to prevent procrastination.
- **Example**:
  - "Email **Emily** to confirm the meeting agenda."

#### **Type 2: Complex Projects**

- **Description**: Tasks that require planning, strategizing, and initiating complex activities.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Involves multiple stages and may span extended periods.
  - The executive initiates and monitors progress.
- **Example**:
  - "Develop a new market entry strategy with **Carlos** and the team."

#### **Type 3: Time-Bound Tasks**

- **Description**: Activities scheduled for specific times that require the executive's presence.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Time-sensitive and non-flexible.
  - Often involve other participants.
- **Example**:
  - "Attend the quarterly review meeting with **Samantha** on Friday at 10 AM."

#### **Type 4: Dependent Tasks**

- **Description**: Tasks contingent on other events or information before action can be taken.
- **Characteristics**:
  - May have multiple dependencies.
  - Becomes actionable (often as Type 1) once dependencies are resolved.
- **Example**:
  - "After **Michael** sends the sales report, prepare the presentation for **John**."

### **3. People Directory**

- **Purpose**: A centralized repository of individuals the executive interacts with, capturing personal details, relationships, and preferences.
- **Content**:
  - **Personal Information**: Full name, designation, contact details.
  - **Relationship**: Nature of the relationship (e.g., manager, client, team member).
  - **Preferences**: Communication style, availability, important dates.
  - **Associated Tasks**: Tasks linked to the individual.
- **Usage**:
  - Enhances task prioritization based on the importance of the individual.
  - Provides context for interactions and helps tailor communication.
