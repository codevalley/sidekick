# **Updated Project Specification: Sidekick â€“ Your Executive Assistant**

## **Introduction**

Sidekick is an intelligent personal assistant for executives, functioning as a second brain to enhance productivity and reliability. This updated specification refines the implementation plan based on the current system prompt and main.py file, focusing on a JSON-based interaction model and local file storage.

## **Objectives**

- **Natural Language Interaction**: Enable users to communicate with Sidekick using natural language inputs.
- **Intelligent Processing**: Utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) to interpret inputs, classify them, and extract structured information.
- **JSON-based Communication**: Implement a standardized JSON structure for all interactions between the user, Sidekick, and the LLM.
- **Local Document Management**: Store and manage data in structured JSON files within the same folder as the agent.
- **Task, People, and Context Management**: Efficiently handle tasks, contacts, and contextual information.
- **Two-Stage Processing**: Implement a Context Gathering stage followed by an Entity Extraction stage for comprehensive understanding.

## **System Architecture**

### **1. Core Components**

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: The primary interface for user interaction, implemented using prompt_toolkit.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo for natural language processing.
- **Local Storage**: JSON files for storing tasks, people, and context information.
- **Configuration Management**: YAML file for storing API keys and system prompts.

### **2. File Structure**

- `main.py`: The main application file.
- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for API keys and system prompts.
- `tasks.json`: Stores all task entries.
- `people.json`: Stores all people profiles.
- `topics.json`: Stores all context/knowledge base entries.

### **3. Data Models**

#### Task
```json
{
  "task_id": "<unique_identifier>",
  "type": "<1|2|3|4>",
  "description": "<task_description>",
  "status": "<active|pending|completed>",
  "actions": ["<action1>", "<action2>", ...],
  "people": {
    "owner": "<name>",
    "final_beneficiary": "<name>",
    "stakeholders": ["<name1>", "<name2>", ...]
  },
  "dependencies": ["<dependency1>", "<dependency2>", ...],
  "schedule": "<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>",
  "priority": "<high|medium|low>"
}
```

#### Person
```json
{
  "person_id": "<unique_identifier>",
  "name": "<full_name>",
  "designation": "<job_title>",
  "relationship": "<relationship_to_user>",
  "importance": "<high|medium|low>",
  "notes": "<additional_information>",
  "contact": {
    "email": "<email_address>",
    "phone": "<phone_number>"
  }
}
```

#### Topic
```json
{
  "topic_id": "<unique_identifier>",
  "name": "<topic_name>",
  "description": "<detailed_description>",
  "keywords": ["<keyword1>", "<keyword2>", ...],
  "related_people": ["<person_name1>", "<person_name2>", ...],
  "related_tasks": ["<task_id1>", "<task_id2>", ...]
}
```

## **Interaction Flow**

1. **User Input**: The user enters a natural language query or command.
2. **Context Gathering**: Sidekick loads the current context from local JSON files and enters the first stage of processing.
3. **LLM Processing (Stage 1)**: The input and context are sent to the LLM for initial processing and understanding.
4. **Entity Extraction (Stage 2)**: The LLM performs a second pass to extract structured information and generate a response.
5. **Response Generation**: The LLM generates a structured JSON response.
6. **Data Update**: If necessary, Sidekick updates the local JSON files with new or modified information.
7. **User Feedback**: Sidekick presents the processed information or actions to the user.

## **Key Functionalities**

### **1. Natural Language Processing**

- Sidekick uses the LLM to interpret the user's natural language inputs in two stages.
- The system classifies inputs and extracts relevant information to populate the structured data models.

### **2. Task Management**

- Create, update, and list tasks with various attributes (type, priority, schedule, etc.).
- Automatically assign task IDs and manage task dependencies.
- Provide task summaries and prioritized to-do lists.

### **3. Contact Management**

- Add and update contact information for people relevant to the executive's work.
- Associate people with tasks and contexts.
- Manage relationship information and importance levels.

### **4. Context/Knowledge Management**

- Store and retrieve contextual information related to projects, topics, or domains.
- Link contexts with relevant tasks and people.
- Provide quick access to important information during decision-making processes.

### **5. Intelligent Recommendations**

- Offer task prioritization based on deadlines, importance, and dependencies.
- Suggest next actions or focus areas based on the current context and workload.
- Provide reminders for upcoming deadlines or important events.

## **Implementation Details**

### **1. Configuration Management**

- Use `config.yaml` to store the OpenAI API key and system prompt.
- Load configuration at application startup.

### **2. LLM Integration**

- Utilize OpenAI's API to interact with GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo.
- Implement two-stage processing: Context Gathering and Entity Extraction.
- Construct prompts that include the current context and user input.
- Parse LLM responses and extract structured data.

### **3. Data Persistence**

- Use JSON files (`tasks.json`, `people.json`, `topics.json`) for local storage.
- Implement functions to load, update, and save data to these files.
- Ensure data integrity and handle concurrent access if needed.

### **4. User Interface**

- Implement a command-line interface using the `prompt_toolkit` library.
- Display formatted output using the `rich` library for enhanced readability.
- Provide visual indicators for processing status and data updates.

- Implement robust error handling for API calls and data processing.
- Provide clear error messages to the user.
- Log errors and important events for debugging and auditing.

## **Workflows**

### **1. Adding a New Task**

2. Sidekick processes the input through the LLM in two stages.
3. LLM extracts task information and suggests a structured task object.
4. Sidekick presents the extracted information to the user for confirmation.
5. Upon confirmation, Sidekick adds the task to `tasks.json`.
6. Sidekick provides confirmation and any relevant follow-up questions.

### **2. Updating Existing Information**

1. User requests an update to a task, person, or topic entry.
2. Sidekick identifies the relevant entry using provided IDs or contextual information.
3. LLM processes the update request in two stages and suggests modifications.
4. Sidekick presents the proposed changes to the user for confirmation.
5. Upon confirmation, Sidekick updates the relevant JSON file.
6. Sidekick provides confirmation of the update.

### **3. Generating Reports or Summaries**

1. User requests a summary or report (e.g., task list, contact information).
2. Sidekick retrieves relevant information from JSON files.
3. LLM processes the data in two stages and generates a structured summary.
4. Sidekick presents the summary to the user in a formatted manner.

## **Future Enhancements**
